Objects:
- Requestors
  - Things that want to request things

Rules:
- A request is only allowed to be made if there is at least 1 remaining alloted request
  - Variable to hold remaining requests
- If there are 0 remaing alloted requests, then the next request can go once time has reached the reset time
  - variable to hold reset time
  - Delay
- Requests must go in order received
  - Queue
  
Ideas:
- Queue of GUIDs
  - Requestors call a rate limiter method which might make the requestor wait
  - the rate limiter creates a guid for that call and adds to a queue
  - periodically it peeks the item in front of the queue to see if it is its guid
  - if it peeks its guid, it checks if there are available requests
  - if yes, it returns, if no, it waits until the reset time, then returns
